Every now and then I like to put together an infographic poster as quickly as I can. My latest attempt is this poster of World Marathon Courses.

It is inspired by Neil Freeman’s [Subway systems at the same scale](http://fakeisthenewreal.org/subway/) poster; which shows 140 of the world’s metro systems side-by-side.

Let me walk you through the process of putting it together and describe some of the decisions I had to make along the way.
