Union and intersection types have fairly suggestive names. Most of what follows isn't programming language specific
but I'm going to use TypeScript as the example language.

Let's start with a union type. Typescript defines this as:

> A type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types.

Here is a function that can operate on strings or numbers:

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log('Your ID is: ' + id)
}
```

It’s easy to provide a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching any of the union’s members.
If you have a value of a union type, how do you work with it?

TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union. For example, if you have the union string | number, you can’t use methods that are only available on string:

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log(id.toUpperCase());
Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.
}
```

Makes sense. Where this sometimes trips us up is when we apply it to objects. Take the following two types:

```ts
type A = {
  a: string
  b: number
}

type B = {
  a: string
  c: boolean
}
```

Let's combine them into one union type:

```ts
type C = A | B
```

Just like before we can assign a value matching matching of the union's members, e.g.

```ts
const obj: C = { a: 'foo', b: 1 }
```

However, when we come to apply an operation to a value of the union type we see something interesting.
If the operation is reading a property then we can only read a property that is present for every member of the union.
A property is present for every member if it is in the **intersection** of the properties of all the members.
In this case only `a` is a valid property.

I must admit that this causes me to pause every now and then.
It's a **union** type but when working with objects we only get to apply operations that work for the **intersection** of properties.

The same applies to intersection types and objects.
If we know nothing else about the type but that it's an intersection type then we get to work with the **union** of properties.

It's pretty funny when you think about it.

The terms union and intersection really talk about assignment compatibility.
What operations you can apply to the types require more thought than just transferring the words union and intersection across.
Particularly when working with objects.

This does feel related to the concepts of wider and narrow object types.
Which features a similar flipping of terminology when thinking about object properties.

While I find this makes sense to me now it does remind me of wrapping my head around covariant and contravariant types (specifically in C#).
That often made be double check that I'd got them the right way around.
